# Learning Balance Control PNU2025-1

This is the project repository for our course "Artificial Intelligence in Robotics"
at the Pusan National University, South Korea.

## Goal

The idea for the project came from the following paper:
[Balance Control of a Novel Wheel-legged Robot: Design and Experiments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561579)

We want to replace the LQR controller for keeping the robot upright with a learned policy.

Our project goals are as follows:

1. Setup of the simulation environment and integration with the machine learning framework. âœ…
2. Definition of the robot geometry and training a proof of concept controller for a simple and static
robot state. âœ…
3. Training a controller to balance the robot in its upright equilibrium position while allowing for
changing height. ðŸ”œ
4. Improving the controller further by introducing perturbations such as shifting the center of gravity. ðŸ”œ

## Model

We approximated the robot in the MuJoCo simulation environment by estimating the dimensions from one
of the papers pictures and Table I:

## Results

We were able to train a basic policy for the robot with no height change and no other perturbations:

Reward function:
$`reward = \text{alive} - 0.1 * \text{y\_angle}^2 - 0.1 * \text{x\_angle}^2 - 0.5 * (\text{wheel\_speed\_l}^2 + \text{wheel\_speed\_r}^2) - 10 * \text{x\_dist}`$
